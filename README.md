# Small-NN-Learns-MNIST-Dataset
MNIST is a Dataset that contains 70000 (60000 Train and 10000 Test) Labeled Images with Handwritten Digits.  
I made a small neural network with my [Simple Neural Network Library](https://github.com/irineos/simple-Neural-Network-library-in-C) and trained it in this Dataset.
